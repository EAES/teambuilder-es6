## TeamBuilder (ES6) [WIP]
A personal challenge to code a Pokémon Team Builder app completely in vanilla es6 and vanilla css3

"Wondering if your team has what it takes to get through the Elite 4? Build your team with TeamBuilder and make sure you cover your weaknesses!"

**Home screen:** 

*See your team's weaknesses and try and cover your bases!*

**Add Modal**

*Search for your favorite pokémon and see their stats before you add it to your team*
